# Eat-Da-Burger

##Problem
The app's intention is to allow users to post burgers they would like to eat, and then maintain a record of them as consumed after they consume them

##Overview
The user clicks writes the type of burger they would like to eat in a form. The 'submit' is clicked, and then the burger appears with a 'DEVourE' button next to it in a section dedicated to undevoured burgers. Once 'DEVourE' is clicked the burger moves to another section with other devoured burgers. The information is mantained in databases and tables held on servers. It is deployed on the Heroku app.

##Instructions
From Github repository clone files to your directory. Open them in a command line prompt. Run "npm i", then run "node server.js"
